# My Project

## Overview

This project consists of a Flask-based backend API and a frontend application. The backend provides a REST API with GET and POST methods, while the frontend is a simple web application that interacts with this API.

### Backend

The backend is implemented using Flask and provides the following endpoints:

- **`GET /bfhl`**: Returns an operation code.
- **`POST /bfhl`**: Accepts JSON data and processes it to separate numbers and alphabets, find the highest lowercase alphabet, and returns a detailed response.

### Frontend

The frontend is a vanilla JavaScript application with HTML and CSS. It includes:
- A text input field to accept JSON input.
- Validation and error handling for incorrect JSON formats.
- A multi-select dropdown to filter and display results based on the userâ€™s choice.
